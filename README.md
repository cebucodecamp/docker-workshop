## What is it?



## Words & Terminology

Docker uses a bunch of concepts and has specific words for those. To be able to read documentation, and to talk to others, it's very important to understand what they mean.

In the following I'm trying to show a few analogue words from related domains, such as VMs or programming runtimes.

| Docker | VMs | AWS EC2 | Python | Node JS |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|---------|
| Image | VM Snapshot | [AMI](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) | .py file | .js file |
| Container | Running VM | EC2 | Running Python process | running Node process |
| Docker Hub | ? | AWS Marketplace for AMIs | [official pypi](https://pypi.python.org/) | the official [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) |
| Docker registry | ? | - | A pypi server | an npm server |
